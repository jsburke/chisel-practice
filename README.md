# Chisel Practice

This Repo contains the active development of Chisel microprojects to scale up learning Chisel from begginer levels to intermediate and hopefully to some advanced topics.  As of present the repo is in flux.  Forked from [the chisel template](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chisel-template), I've left the initial GCD example in there, and will add other pieces.  My hope is that as time goes, along with the code I can add explantions of what is going on beyond the comments alone.

## Projects

A listing of the contained projects will go here.

## How to run the tests

In general, the tests found here can be launched as follows:

```sh
  sbt 'testOnly <package_name>.<test_name>'
```

This will be elaborated within the individual tests.
